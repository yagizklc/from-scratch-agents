Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tool_schemas}

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `tool_name` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `params` key (with the input parameters as a list of tuples).

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:
Action:

$JSON_BLOB (inside markdown cell)

Observation: the result of the action. This Observation is unique, complete, and the source of truth.
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.)

You must always end your output with the following format:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters `Final Answer:` when you provide a definitive answer.
